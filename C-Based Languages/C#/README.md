# C# Style Guide

While most of Ignia's front-end code is written exclusively in HTML5 (without any server preprocessing), we predominantly rely on C# for service layers (e.g., exposing REST APIs). Much of our C# guidelines inherit from our general [C-Based Languages](../README.md) guidelines, although there are some specific considerations unique to C#.

## Identifiers
