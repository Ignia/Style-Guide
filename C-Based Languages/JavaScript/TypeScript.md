# Type Script Style Guide

[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a JavaScript compiler that provides type safety to JavaScript and can help discover runtime bugs during the compilation process. Google has announced that it will be collaborating with Microsoft to extend TypeScript with new features such as annotations (previously targeted for their own [AtScript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YUzC-1d0V1-Q3V0fQ7KSit97HnZoKVygDxpWzEYW0U/edit) superset of TypeScript). While Ignia is currently targeting [ECMAScript 6](./ECMAScript%206.md), we will be migrating code to TypeScript 2.0 upon its release (TypeScript 2.0 will be a superset of ECMAScript 6).

> *Note:* This style guide inherits rules from the [JavaScript Style Guide](./README.md), [C-Based Languages Style Guide](../README.md), and the [Global Style Guide](../../README.md)
