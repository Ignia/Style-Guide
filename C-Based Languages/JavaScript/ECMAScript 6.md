# ECMAScript 6.0

ECMAScript is the standard behind JavaScript. ECMAScript 6.0 (sometimes, incorrectly, referred to as JavaScript 6.0) is a significant update - arguably the most significant in the history of the language - and introduces a lot of new syntax, types, and capabilities. While most browsers do not yet support ECMAScript 6, Ignia is developing for it today using transpilers such as [Google Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
