# Legacy Style Guides

The [style guides presented here](../README.md) are not only a reflection of evolving community conventions, but also a long heritage of Ignia's own internal style guides and coding standards, which date back to our inception in 1998. While some of these standards are dated, many remain surprisingly relevant today. We share these as an acknowledgments of that history, and to provide background and context for our current standards.
